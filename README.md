# PathFinding-Algorithm
My implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm using C++.
This implementation find the shortest path in terms of cheapest cost to reach the end goal in a square grid.
The grid contains 4 different weights and cells which cannot be traversed into.

After the path is find, the code will print out the grid and color the path with green until it reaches the end point which would be colored in red.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
